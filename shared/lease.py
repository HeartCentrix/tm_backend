"""Atomic lease claim + renewal with fence tokens.

A *lease* is a (lease_owner_id, lease_expires_at, lease_token) triple
stored on every work row (``jobs``, ``snapshots``, ``snapshot_partitions``).
The fence token is a monotonic counter — bumped on every claim and on
every reconciler sweep — that defends against a resurrected stale
worker writing over fresh state. Any state UPDATE the worker issues
carries ``WHERE lease_token = :my_token``, so a worker whose lease was
re-taken writes 0 rows and aborts cleanly.

Design ref: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-distributed-reconciliation-design.md §6.

This module is the SQL primitives only — wiring into the per-handler
message path is done by the worker (see ``with_lease`` context manager).
