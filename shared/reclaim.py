"""Startup reclaim — re-release work owned by this replica before its
last restart.

Called once per worker boot, BEFORE consuming starts. Finds work rows
whose ``lease_owner_id`` matches our previous worker_uuid (resolved
from ``replica_id`` via the ``worker_heartbeats`` table) and whose
lease has expired by definition (the worker that held it just
restarted). Clears the lease and bumps the fence token; the
reconciler's next sweep then picks them up and finalizes/re-enqueues
as appropriate.

This closes the redeploy gap to <1 s instead of waiting up to
``LEASE_TTL_S + sweep_interval`` for the periodic sweep.

Design ref: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-distributed-reconciliation-design.md §9.2.

      1. Find ``worker_heartbeats`` rows for this replica with a
         different ``worker_id`` (= our previous process incarnation).
