"""Content-addressable dedup for blob uploads.

At enterprise scale (5k users × 400 TiB) the same binary content
appears many times across a tenant: one attachment forwarded to 50
mailboxes, the company policy PDF shared across 500 OneDrives, the
same screenshot pasted into 30 chats. Uploading each copy wastes
bandwidth, storage, and the NIC seconds the worker could spend on
new content.

This helper lets callers check whether (tenant, content_hash) is
already backed by a blob somewhere in the DB and, if so, reuse the
existing blob_path instead of uploading. The lookup hits the
existing (tenant_id, content_checksum) index — `idx_snapshot_items_
tenant_checksum` — so it's O(log n) even at hundreds of millions of
rows.

Scoped to same-tenant only so one customer's files never leak into
another customer's blob namespace, even under path-collision edge
cases.

In-process TTL-LRU layer
------------------------
File backups commonly hit the same content_hash repeatedly within a
short window: a chat attachment shared across 50 users, a tenant
templates folder, OneDrive auto-versions of slowly-evolving Office
docs. Each repeat lookup is one round-trip to PG's index. A small
in-memory TTL cache turns the repeat into O(1) memory access.

Defaults tuned for a worker holding ~10k unique hashes in working
set; entries expire after 5 minutes so transient PG state never
goes stale beyond the next backup tick. Per-tenant key scope.
