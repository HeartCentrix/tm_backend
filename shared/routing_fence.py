"""Routing fence — defend against wrong-queue delivery.

Every work message carries an envelope:

    {"expected_workload": "USER_CHATS",
     "route_hops":        0,
     "payload":           {...}}

The worker checks ``expected_workload`` against the workloads its
current consumer handles. On mismatch:

  * re-publish to the correct queue (up to 2 hops)
  * if hops exceeds the cap, log + insert into ``work_dead_letter``
    and ACK the message so it doesn't ping-pong forever.

This is layer 4 of the reconciliation design.
