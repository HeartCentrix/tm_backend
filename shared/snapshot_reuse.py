"""Snapshot-reuse chain helpers.

A "reuse" snapshot owns zero ``snapshot_items`` rows; it points (via
``reuse_of_snapshot_id``) at the immediately-prior stable snapshot of
the same resource, and (via ``reuse_chain_root_id``) at the terminal
full snapshot whose rows actually represent the inventory.

Every reader of ``snapshot_items`` must resolve through
``resolve_snapshot_items_target`` before issuing the query, so the
chain is transparent to callers. For pre-deploy snapshots and every
full (non-reuse) snapshot, both columns are NULL and the resolver
returns ``snapshot_id`` unchanged — behaviour is identical to today.
