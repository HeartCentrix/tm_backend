"""Tests for chat-export-worker file-path coordination.

These pin the rule that the inline image src URLs the normalizer puts
into the rendered HTML / PDF MUST match the file paths the packager
actually writes inside the ZIP. Pre-fix the consumer used a raw
last-segment of `thread_path` (no sanitisation, no layout awareness)
while the packager used `_safe_name(thread_name)` + per-message
sub-folders — so every chat thread whose name contained a colon
(Teams group chats are like that by default) exported as broken
images and broken attachment links.

We also pin:
  - per-message HTML's CSS link points up the right number of levels
  - per-message attachment hrefs are relative to the HTML (not zip root)
  - reaction emoji rendering uses the glyph table

chat-export-worker has a hyphen in its dir, so the helpers are loaded
via the same AST extraction pattern used elsewhere in this suite.
