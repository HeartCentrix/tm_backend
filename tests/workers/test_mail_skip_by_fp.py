"""Unit tests for `_compute_mail_skip_by_fp` — the USER_MAIL
skip-by-fingerprint decision function.

The function is the structural fix for the production incident on
2026-05-14 where Amit Mishra's mailbox (40 folders, partition fanout
into 2 shards) returned a snapshot with only Inbox (925 messages) and
zero rows from the other 39 folders. The second-finishing shard read
fingerprints written by the first shard and skipped its entire
allowlist. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-15-mail-folder-fingerprint-table-design.md.

These tests pin the decision behavior so any future refactor can't
silently re-introduce the race.
